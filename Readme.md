# 👋 Hey there, I’m **Bello Said Ahmed**

### 💻 Software Engineer | 🤖 Exploring Machine Learning & AI | 🌱 Documenting My Journey

Hi! I’m Bello — a software engineer on a mission to understand **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** from the ground up.  
I’m learning in public to stay accountable, grow consistently, and hopefully inspire others who are just getting started too.

## 🧠 My Learning Journey

My learning path in AI/ML has been all about **building from the basics** — one concept at a time.  

I started with **Pandas**, where I learned how to **clean, organize, and analyze datasets**. It helped me understand how real-world data often looks messy — and how to transform it into something meaningful.  

Then I explored **NumPy**, which strengthened my ability to handle **large numerical data efficiently** and perform mathematical operations at scale. It taught me how to think in **arrays and matrices**, the building blocks of data science.  

After that, I moved to **Matplotlib**, where I learned to **visualize insights** and make data tell a story.  
As a small project, I created a **heart disease visualization** using Matplotlib — analyzing medical data and saving it as an image. It was my first real taste of turning data into something *visual and informative*.  

Now, I’m currently learning **Scikit-learn**, diving into **machine learning algorithms**, understanding how to train models, evaluate them, and make predictions. This stage feels like the bridge between understanding data and building intelligent systems.

Each step has connected the dots a little more — from data cleaning, to analysis, to visualization, and now to machine learning itself.

## 🎯 Things I Plan to Learn in AI/ML

1. **Python** – writing clean, efficient code  
2. **Jupyter Notebook** – visualizing ideas quickly  
3. **Docker** – packaging ML apps easily *(up next)*  
4. **CI/CD** – automating workflows *(up next)*  
5. **AWS / Azure** – cloud skills for real-world deployment *(up next)*  
6. **SQL** – managing and querying data *(up next)*  
7. **Kubernetes** – scaling ML models in production *(up next)*

## ⚙️ Current Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript (Node.js), PHP  
**Frameworks:** Express, Laravel  
**Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, Postman  
**Cloud:** AWS (learning), Azure (learning)

## 💬 Why I’m Doing This

I’m not just interested in *using* AI — I want to **understand how it truly works**.  
By combining my software engineering background with ML/AI principles, I aim to build **practical, data-driven solutions** that solve real-world problems.  

I believe that learning openly — one concept at a time — helps not just me, but anyone else walking a similar path.

## 🚀 Next Step: Kaggle Practice & Real-World Projects

I’ve completed the core foundations of data handling and visualization — now it’s time to **apply what I’ve learned** through real-world practice on **Kaggle**.  

Starting tomorrow, I’ll begin working on Kaggle notebooks to strengthen my understanding of model building, experimentation, and performance evaluation.  
This marks the beginning of my **Stage 2: Practical Learning Phase**, where I’ll focus on applying theory to real data, improving my problem-solving skills, and learning by doing.
