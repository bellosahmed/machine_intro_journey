# 👋 Hey there, I’m **Bello Said Ahmed**

### 💻 Software Engineer | 🤖 Exploring Machine Learning & AI | 🌱 Documenting My Journey

Hi! I’m Bello — a software engineer on a mission to understand **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** from the ground up.  
I’m learning in public to stay accountable, grow consistently, and hopefully inspire others who are just getting started too.

## 🧠 My Learning Journey

Before you can visualize data, you have to **understand and shape it** — and that’s where **NumPy** comes in.  

I’m currently learning **NumPy**, which is like the foundation of data science and machine learning in Python.  
It helps you work with **large amounts of data efficiently**, perform **mathematical operations quickly**, and structure your data in ways that make sense for analysis.  

In simple terms: NumPy teaches you how to **think in arrays**, not just variables — preparing your data to be cleaned, explored, and understood.  

Once I get comfortable manipulating and analyzing data with NumPy, I’ll move on to **Matplotlib** — where numbers start to come alive through charts and visual stories.

## 🎯 Things I Plan to Learn in AI/ML

1. **Python** – writing clean, efficient code  
2. **Jupyter Notebook** – visualizing ideas quickly  
3. **Docker** – packaging ML apps easily  
4. **CI/CD** – automating workflows  
5. **AWS / Azure** – cloud skills for real-world deployment  
6. **SQL** – managing and querying data  
7. **Kubernetes** – scaling ML models in production

## ⚙️ Current Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript (Node.js), PHP  
**Frameworks:** Express, Laravel  
**Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, Postman, VS Code  
**Cloud:** AWS (learning), Azure (learning)

## 💬 Why I’m Doing This

I’m not just interested in *using* AI — I want to **understand how it truly works**.  
By combining my software engineering background with ML/AI principles, I aim to build **practical, data-driven solutions** that solve real-world problems.  

I believe that learning openly — one concept at a time — helps not just me, but anyone else walking a similar path.
